# Weather-App
Weather SPA | Educational purposes | Ivan Dimitrov

Weather application, made with custom router and templating library - 'lit-html'.
1.1 I am using the free plan in openweathermap to get information for the weather, to practice my work with different APIs and 
asynchronous javascript.
1.2 I use Firebase as BaaS to handle my login and register functionality. Again it is made to practice work with different APIs, i know there is no logic to login and register in weather app.
1.3 The main idea is not the html and css, thats why i allowed myself not to be perfect in them, the purpose was to train the gained skills in the JS - APPS course.

//App finished. 
-Responsive design missing because of the main purpose on the app build(1.3).
-Full weather report missing because of the free plan. That's why i have only this functionality.
